# Generated Files

- All `.h` files in this folder are used for the kernel to use the generated `.c` files
- **Important**: They are designed to stay in this folder. **Do *NOT* remove them**
- Generation scripts should go into `/src/build-scripts`
- Generation scripts should be ran by the `generate-all.sh` script
- Generation scripts should clean up after themselves and be designed to clean up before running to always work
